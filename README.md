## üöÄ Core Features & Functionality (As of September 10, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Booking & Payment System
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Fully integrated with **SSLCommerz**, a leading payment gateway in Bangladesh, for all transactions.
- **Complete Payment Flow**: Users can pay for approved services via a secure, hosted checkout page (EasyCheckout) supporting cards, mobile banking (bKash, Nagad), and internet banking.
- **Secure Confirmation (IPN)**: Implemented a secure webhook (IPN) listener with server-side transaction validation to automatically update a booking's status to "Confirmed" in the database upon successful payment.
- **Negotiable Price Workflow**: Added a complete quote-and-approve system. Providers can approve negotiable bookings with a final, custom price, which is then presented to the customer for payment.

### ‚úÖ Unified Experience & Core Infrastructure
- **Consistent UI/UX**: A professional, fixed-sidebar dashboard layout has been implemented for all user roles with refined headers and spacing.
- **Active Sidebar Navigation**: All dashboards now feature active link highlighting, clearly showing the user which page they are currently on for improved usability.
- **Role-Based Navigation & Redirects**: Login and post-action redirects are correctly handled for all roles and scenarios, including `returnUrl` functionality.
- **Full Timezone Conversion**: A site-wide timezone service ensures all data is stored as UTC and all displayed timestamps are correctly converted to GMT+6 (Dhaka Standard Time).

### ‚úÖ Service Provider Portal
- **Unified Master Profile**: A single, master profile page that serves as both the public-facing profile (for customers) and the private dashboard homepage (for the owner), with content dynamically adjusted based on the viewer.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: The provider profile page intelligently loads the correct layout (public, user dashboard, admin dashboard, or full provider dashboard) based on the viewer's role.
- **Public Trust Stats**: The public profile displays key "Trust Stats" (Total Jobs, Completed, etc.) to build customer confidence.
- **Redesigned Management Pages**: All provider-facing management pages (e.g., "My Services") have been redesigned for a modern, consistent, and user-friendly experience, featuring thumbnails and modal-based confirmations.

### ‚úÖ User Dashboard & Public Pages
- **Full Site Integration**: All public service cards and details pages now correctly link to the provider's new master profile page.
- **Interactive Homepage & Search**: A modern landing page and AJAX-powered "Load More" functionality for service discovery.
- **Profile Management**: Users have a dedicated "My Profile" page which now serves as their default dashboard homepage.
